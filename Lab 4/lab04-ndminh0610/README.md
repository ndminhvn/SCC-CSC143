2. readable: if you can't see the coding big picture quickly, then it's not readable.
3. understandable: when you read your code "is this understandable to a beginner"?
4. clean: precise and to the point (no extra fuss...with in reason of course)
5. efficient: short to the point, has both time and space efficiency.
